## Why I made this
As simple as this project looks, I created it to show that I can work with objects.

## What I learned 
The main thing I learned was how you can sort through an array of objects. Something I found more interesting though, is that I was able to learn how to store the objects in your local device, that way each time you visit the site, the books you've added are still there and you are still able edit the information.

## I'm glad I've worked on this
With projects like this and other projects yet to come, I am really glad I spent a good amount of time learning how to problem solve. This has really helped be able to find and squash bugs that present themself. This project came with a few bugs, but when going through the process logically, it's quick to see what went wrong.
